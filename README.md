# RobotSwarm

RobotSwarm is a highly generic and extendable framework designed for simulating and controlling a swarm of robots. The architecture leverages the power of generics and interfaces to create a modular system that can easily incorporate new functionalities and adapt to various swarm scenarios.

## Key Features

- **Generic Architecture:** Utilizes generics to ensure type safety and reusability across different robot types and operations.
- **Interface-Driven Design:** Employs interfaces to define clear contracts, making it easy to integrate new behaviors and functionalities without altering the core system.
- **Extensibility:** Easily add or modify robot behaviors, communication protocols, and control algorithms.
- **Modular Components:** Separated into distinct modules for simulation, control, and data processing, facilitating maintenance and future enhancements.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of RobotSwarm is to provide a versatile and scalable platform for robot swarm simulation and control. The framework is designed to be as general as possible, allowing to extend and customize the system without needing to modify the underlying architecture.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/lorenzoArcangeli/RobotSwarm.git
  cd RobotSwarm
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
